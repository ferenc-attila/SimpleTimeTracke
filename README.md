# SimpleTimeTracker

A simple CLI daily Time Tracker application written in Java, learning basics of Java SE.

You can start or stop recordings.

Recordings stored inside activities.
You can create activities, and then you can select one for new recording.

When you exit, the program writes collected information into csv.
When you start it next time, it reads the data collected earlier from csv.

It isn't finished yet!
Working, but it needs refactoring code cleaning, there are lots of missing tests.
